                        <p>Our timelines are determined by the size and scope of each individual project. After a kickoff meeting, these details will be set in stone and communicated to the client clearly. Efficiency is a two-way street, so we expect that our clients will provide us with the necessary assets we need in order to keep our deliverables on track.</p>
