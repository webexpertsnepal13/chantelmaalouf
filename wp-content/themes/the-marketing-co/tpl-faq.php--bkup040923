                    <div class="content">
                        <p>I use a wide range of products from many different b rands including Chanel, MAC and Tom Ford. I do not solely use one Makeup brand company as I believe each company has a distinct product that they pride themselves on or that I find to favor in most companies. Only high quality and high performing products are in my kit to ensure your makeup is flawless on camera. All products are tested for performance prior to making it into my collection. Please contact me with any questions regarding allergies in your party.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely. A true professional makeup application will last the full duration of your event. Not only are the eyes and skin prepared with the proper skin care and priming products, but you will be set and finished with professional powders and sprays that seal in and h elp fix the makeup in place. All the products in between the prepping and sealing are chosen for their longevity and high performance in all tear/sweat and weather conditions.</p>
